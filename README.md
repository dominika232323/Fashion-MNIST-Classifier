# Fashion-MNIST-Classifier

This repository contains a simple pipeline for training a model on the Fashion MNIST dataset.

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Training the Model

Run the Jupyter Notebook train_and_evaluate_fashion_mnist.ipynb, which:

* Loads the Fashion MNIST dataset
* Imports the model from model.py
* Imports the training function from train.py
* Trains the model
* Evaluates accuracy on the test set

After training, the model's accuracy on the Fashion MNIST test set will be displayed in the notebook output.
